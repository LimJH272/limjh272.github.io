                Hello! I am a Term 4 Sophomore at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) pillar. My interest in coding and programming has driven my systematic thinking and project planning skills that allow me to constantly update myself with concepts and skills from the past, present and future. My past experience as SUTD Cuesports Club's tech executive allowed me to apply my Python programming skills to its fullest by improving the user experience and functionality of our club's Telegram bot. Also, my passion in computing and computation structures enables me to have a deep understanding of the basic principles and functions of computing devices, and working on school projects strengthened my knowledge on Android and Java programming, as well as user interface design through Figma.<br>
                <br>
                I take pride in diligence, empathy, persistence, punctuality and hard work. My experience of being a teaching assistant in Term 3 has further fueled my passion in empowering others through teaching and learning. As a University Ambassador, I do my very best to uplift SUTD's name and pride as a distinguished education institution. I am also active in extra-curricular activities and participate in various student clubs in my free time.<br>
                <br>
                Feel free to contact me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/limjiehan0272/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:limjiehan02@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>. I always look forward to a nice conversation with you!
