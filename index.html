                Hello! I am a Class of 2025 Bachelor's graduate from the Singapore University of Technology and Design
                (SUTD) under the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) pillar. My interest in coding and
                programming has driven my systematic thinking and project planning skills that allow me to constantly
                update myself with concepts and skills from the past, present and future. As an aspiring artificial
                intelligence (AI) engineer, I have got diverse project experiences in ML, AI, deep learning, data
                science and computer science, and I have worked with large language models (LLMs) during my
                part-time internship at GenVoice as a machine learning (ML) research intern.<br>
                <br>
                I take pride in diligence, empathy, persistence, punctuality and hard work. My experience of being a
                teaching assistant for mathematics and ML has further fueled my passion in empowering others through
                teaching and learning. I am also active in extra-curricular activities and participate in various
                student clubs in my free time.<br>
                <br>
                Feel free to contact me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/limjiehan0272/"
                    target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:limjiehan02@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>. I
                always look forward to a nice conversation with you!
