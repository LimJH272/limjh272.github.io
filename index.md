# About Me
I am a Class of 2025 Bachelor's graduate from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) pillar. My interest in coding and programming has driven my systematic thinking and project planning skills that allow me to constantly update myself with concepts and skills from the past, present and future. Being highly interested in artificial intelligence (AI), I have worked with different large language models (LLMs) during my part-time internship at GenVoice as a machine learning (ML) researcher, and I am currently taking courses on computer vision and natural language processing in SUTD.

I take pride in diligence, empathy, persistence, punctuality and hard work. My experience of being a teaching assistant for mathematics and ML has further fueled my passion in empowering others through teaching and learning. As a University Ambassador, I do my very best to uplift SUTD's name and pride as a distinguished education institution. I am also active in extra-curricular activities and participate in various student clubs in my free time.

Feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/limjiehan0272/){:target="_blank"} or email at [limjiehan02@gmail.com](mailto://limjiehan02@gmail.com). I always look forward to a fruitful conversation with you!

# Research Experience
**Classification of Architectural Styles**<br>
UROP, SUTD | *Jan - Aug 2023*
* Collected image data from online sources to train machine learning models that could determine the style of cultural architecture and buildings.
* Analysed different architectural styles in Asia to gain insights on improvements on our machine learning model’s accuracy.
* Formulated ideas for effective data collection and processing to simplify workflow.

# Academic Projects
**Predictive Forecasting and Reporting**<br>
Final-Year Capstone Project, SUTD | *Sept 2024 - Apr 2025*
* Collaborated with Johnson Controls to develop a dashboard powered by machine learning that shows key financial metrics and sales trends of the company.
* Analysed large amounts of company sales data using Microsoft Excel and Jupyter Notebook to visualise data trends and identify forecastable metrics.
* Trained various prediction and forecasting models based on decision trees and random forests to accurately project the company’s future financial performance.
* Visualised forecasted on an interactive dashboard on Power BI that can be updated easily.
* Automated the data analysis, forecasting and visualisation workflow to enable scheduled weekly data updates.

**Moodify – Emotion Detection from Music**<br>
50.038 Computational Data Science, SUTD | *Jan - Apr 2025*
* Worked in a team of 3 students to build a music emotion detection system using deep learning and data science.
* Explored neural network architectures that could perform audio analysis and classification tasks and built them using the PyTorch framework.
* Obtained labelled music datasets from various online sources and merged them to be used to train music emotion classification models.
* Applied feature engineering to extract spectrograms and MFCCs from waveform datasets which were used for model training and evaluation.
* Developed a simple application using Streamlit to demonstrate the music emotion detection function.

**Visualizing Space Occupancy in Indoor Spaces**<br>
50.035 Computer Vision, SUTD | *Sept - Dec 2024*
* An extension of the OccupEye project to demonstrate computer vision projects such as object detection and convolutional neural networks.
* Trained custom models based on YOLOv11 and CSRNet architectures to detect human persons and chairs within input images.
* Collected image data from free online data sources such as the MIT Indoor Scene Recognition Dataset, as well as self-collected image samples from various rooms and spaces within the SUTD campus.
* Performed data augmentation on collected datasets to enhance the models’ object detection capabilities.

**PottySense**<br>
CS460 Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems, SMU | *Jan - Apr 2024*
* Worked in a team of 5 students to ideate a non-intrusive toileting monitoring system, a collaboration with the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) as part of the SMU-X course.
* Conducted site visits to better understand the expectations for our potential solution, which would assist trainers at MINDS training centres to monitor the trainees’ toileting needs without disrupting teaching activities.
* Developed the monitoring system consisting of a Raspberry Pi 4 server, multiple Arduino microcontrollers with Bluetooth Low Energy capabilities, and Bluetooth trackers to be worn by the users.
* Enabled detection of users present in the toilet by searching for nearby Bluetooth trackers via Bluetooth Low Energy.
* Allowed trainers to monitor the users’ toileting patterns and receive notifications should the users require attention.


**OccupEye**<br>
50.001 Information Systems and Programming, SUTD | *Jan - Apr 2023*
* Collaborated with a team of four to develop a system that consists of a mobile application and an AI-powered vision module that could inform students of the occupancy of common areas on campus in real time.
* Utilised OpenCV and YOLOv5 object detection model to identify the number of room occupants through live image data.
* Awarded the Audience’s Choice for outstanding exhibit at the ISTD Design Exhibition in April 2023.
* Participated in project enhancements in subsequent terms such as migration of vision module from laptop to Raspberry Pi system and maintenance of project display in SUTD i3 Lab till 2024.
